<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This is the portfolio page of Sarah McVittie-Mathews.  You can see screenshots here which link to projects that I have done for my Angela Yu complete full stack web development course.</p>

<p>I am working hard to train in full stack web development with a view to working in the area as a web or software developer.</p>

<p>I hope that this course gives me the experience that I need to apply for a Junior Developer role.</p>
